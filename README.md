# Chatbot with BERT for Customer Service

Welcome to the Chatbot with BERT for Customer Service project! This project focuses on building a chatbot for customer service using the BERT model.

## Introduction

Customer service chatbots help automate responses to common customer inquiries. In this project, we leverage the power of BERT to build a chatbot for customer service using a dataset of common customer service inquiries.

## Dataset

For this project, we will use a custom dataset of customer service inquiries. You can create your own dataset and place it in the `data/customer_service_data.csv` file.

## Project Overview

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Flask
- Pandas

### Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bert_customer_service_chatbot.git
cd bert_customer_service_chatbot

# Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Ensure your data includes customer service inquiries and their labels. Place these files in the data/ directory.
# The data should be in a CSV file with two columns: text and label.

# To fine-tune the BERT model for customer service, run the following command:
python scripts/train.py --data_path data/customer_service_data.csv

# To evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned model, run:
python scripts/evaluate.py --model_path models/ --data_path data/customer_service_data.csv
